                Kero Kero Bonito (KKB) are a British indie pop band from London. 
                The band consists of vocalist Sarah Midori Perry (known by her stage name Sarah Bonito)
                 and producers and multi-instrumentalists Gus Lobban & Jamie Bulled. 
                Their name's meaning is intentionally ambiguous, with one derivation from the Japanese
                 onomatopoeic words for frog croaks and a type of fish.
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kero_Kero_Bonito#cite_note-4">[4]</a> Other meanings include the Brazilian quero-quero bird while “bonito” means
                 “beautiful” in both Portuguese and Spanish, thus "Beautiful Quero-quero" – or even
                  "I want, I want beautiful" in a rough translation.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kero_Kero_Bonito#cite_note-5">[5]</a>
